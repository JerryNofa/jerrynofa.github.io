            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Wallets is a digital bank that leverages phone numbers to provide innovative financial services. By enabling its customers to send and receive money using just phone numbers, Wallets quickly gained popularity in the Nigerian market and distinguished itself in the fintech space. This unique approach drew the attention of industry experts and investors, and helped the company secure a spot in prominent accelerator programs such as Y Combinator. Through its continued focus on innovation and customer-centric services, Wallets has established itself as a leading player in the Nigerian fintech industry.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>At Wallets, I worked as a full-time Product Manger. The primary focus of my work was to enhance customer retention by improving interactions, retention, active users and accessibility for all users, with emphasis on growing the transaction volume and value. To achieve this goal, I carefully considered the user experience and worked to simplify onboarding process, and explored new ways for customers to fund their accounts, making it easy for all users to start using the platform.
            </p> 
            <h4>Fund with crypto (Bitcoin and Ethereum)</h4>
            <p>Wallets was the first digital bank in Nigeria that enabled it's customers fund their account with cryptocurrency. Customers could send Bitcoin or Ethereum to their respective addresses, and the equivalent fiat value in Nigerian Naira would be credited to their accounts.</p>

            <h4>Payment Link (Request Payment)</h4>
            <p>I launched this feature that allowed Wallets customers collect payments by creating a sharable link. Wallets was the pioneer of this feature in the Nigerian market and other fintechs launched this feature in the following years.</p>

            <h4>Onboarding (Signup Process)</h4>
            <p>In order to increase acquisition, I redesigned the onboarding process and user experience. My onboarding process helped remove bottle necks users experienced when signing up and significantly improved percentage of users that successfully signed up on the wallets mobile app.</p>
