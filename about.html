            <h3>BIO</h3>
            <p>
                My journey began in 2011, sort of... when I embarked on a five-year Agricultural Science course at university, but due to disruptions in the Nigerian academic system, my studies were prolonged, providing me with ample free time to teach myself graphic design using Photoshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                After successfully graduating in 2017, I participated in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) program, where I taught Agricultural Science and Mathematics to secondary school students in a remote area. During this time, I enrolled in an employability and entrepreneurship training program, where I led a successful project focused on processing fruits into innovative meal additives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by this experience, I delved into the field of product management, enrolling in online courses and securing an internship at Wallets Africa, a digital bank leveraging phone numbers to provide innovative financial services to its customers. I quickly made an impact by spearheading the launch of an enhanced version of the Wallets app, improving accessibility and driving user engagement. The unique features I implemented resulted in a substantial increase in user engagement and remarkable growth for the company.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, I developed Watchman, a fraud detection system that helped recover lost funds and significantly reduced fraudulent activities at Wallets Africa. I later joined Grolatech Limited, where I led a research team to gather valuable insights from over 5,000 interviews, shaping the development of a loan product that processed millions of transactions and increased the company's revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2021, I joined The GIG group as a Product Manager, playing a pivotal role in the successful transformation of Stellas Microfinance Bank into a digital bank. I led the launch of Stellas Digital Bank and introduced an innovative feature called "Ghost Mode," which revolutionised transaction security and contributed to substantial growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered value to esteemed organisations, leveraging my expertise in product management to drive success. With a proven ability to innovate, lead projects, and deliver exceptional results, I am a highly valuable contributor within the digital technology ecosystem.
