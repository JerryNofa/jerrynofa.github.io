            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Stellas is a digital bank that has simplified digital banking in the fintech space in Nigeria. Stellas previously operated as a microfinance bank that mainly provided loans to small business holders and conducted routine banking operations through walk-in services. However, with the goal of expanding its reach and improving its offerings, I was enlisted to help transition Stellas into a digital bank, harnessing technology to modernize services and cater to a broader clientele.</p>

            <h4>Stellas Launch</h4>
            <p>I led the transformation of the traditional microfinance bank into a digital bank. Starting work on this from May 2021, I designed the overview that shows how the products would be integrated, created product requirements, and oversaw different teams of developers, designers, and QA testers to launch Stellas products.</p>

            <h4>Physical Debit Card</h4>
            <p>I spearheaded the launch of Stellas' debit card on our mobile app, collaborating closely with my team to develop and implement an architecture that fulfilled my specifications. Working alongside the design team, we conducted research and user interviews, refining the design iteratively to create a user-friendly solution that enhances engagement.</p>
            <p>As the project lead, I defined project requirements and oversaw its progress, ensuring a successful launch. I maintained close collaboration with the design team to align our solution with customer needs and preferences, incorporating their feedback and suggestions to refine the design.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, my work resulted in a successful launch of the Stellas debit card on the mobile app, which has allowed our customers to easily request, activate, and manage their cards from their smartphones. The launch also met our project goal to increase engagement on the Stellas app and drive up transaction volume.</p>
